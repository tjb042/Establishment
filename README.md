# Establishment
Establishment is a lightweight .Net input validation library based on whitelisting principles.

It encourages you to validate parameters before they're used in methods by establishing that their value falls within specific 
required ranges, lengths, and formats.

## NuGet
You can find Establishment on NuGet at https://www.nuget.org/packages/Establishment/

Or via the NuGet Package Manager Console:

`PM> Install-Package Establishment`

Its only prerequisite is .Net 4.6.1!
